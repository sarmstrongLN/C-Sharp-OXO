Running the project

On running this console application you will be prompted to set the names for the 2 players.
After providing the names the game will progress until there is either a winner, or the grid is full.
If there is a winner, it will be announced, otherwise a Draw Game message will appear.
You will be prompted to play another game, if you choose to do so you will get the chance to set the player names again.
